# backend
why is there a backend directory? isn't the backend simply handled by a mongodb server?

these are questions you might find yourself wondering. this backend directory is all about:
* defining backend operations that can be performed on the database
* testing these operations

# operations

# testing
there are two ways to test:
* single-shot ```yarn test```
* live reload ```yarn test-reload```
